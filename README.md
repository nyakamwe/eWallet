## Strategies plan to get job done, from day 1 until go-live.
### Phase 1: Project Initiation and Planning
- Engineering Best Practices:
Conduct a technical audit of the existing system to identify pitfalls and challenges.
Implement industry best practices for code readability, maintainability, and performance optimization.
- Engagement with Business Units:
Facilitate workshops and meetings with business teams to translate their requirements into technical specifications.
Use domain-driven design techniques to ensure the back-end aligns seamlessly with business processes.
- Proper Terminology:
Maintain a shared glossary of terms between technical and non-technical teams to ensure clear communication and understanding.
Create detailed technical documentation using standardized terminology and diagrams for easy comprehension.
### Phase 2: Detailed Planning and Design
- Robust API Design:
Collaborate closely with front-end teams to design RESTful APIs that cater to specific front-end use cases.
Implement GraphQL for flexible and efficient data fetching, aligning with diverse front-end requirements.
- Data Model Alignment:
Ensure the back-end data models are designed considering the front-end data needs, allowing for efficient data retrieval and updates.
Implement caching mechanisms to reduce front-end loading times, optimizing the user experience.
### Phase 3: Development
- Scalable Microservices:
Adopt a microservices architecture to create independent, manageable services aligned with different front-end modules.
Use containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for seamless deployment and scaling.
- Collaborative Coding:
Encourage pair programming and cross-functional collaboration to ensure the codebase is coherent and integrates well with the front-end components.
Establish code review standards that involve both back-end and front-end developers for holistic assessments.
### Phase 4: Quality Assurance and Testing
- Comprehensive Testing:
Implement end-to-end testing suites covering both back-end and front-end interactions to validate the system's functionality as a whole.
Utilize tools for API testing and contract testing to ensure compatibility between back-end and front-end components.
- User-Centric Testing:
Integrate real-user monitoring tools to collect data on actual user interactions, helping in refining the back-end to meet front-end expectations.
Engage with UX designers to conduct usability testing, aligning back-end behavior with user expectations.
### Phase 5: Deployment and Pilot System
- Continuous Integration:
Implement CI/CD pipelines that automate integration tests, ensuring each code change aligns with front-end expectations.
Utilize feature flags to enable or disable specific back-end functionalities, allowing front-end teams to test new features selectively.
- User Feedback Loop:
Integrate user feedback mechanisms directly into the application, allowing users to provide input on specific features and functionalities.
Analyze user feedback alongside front-end teams, prioritizing changes that enhance the user experience.
### Phase 6: Refinement and Scaling
- Performance Optimization:
Monitor front-end performance metrics closely, optimizing back-end services based on actual user usage patterns.
Implement lazy loading and asynchronous data fetching to enhance front-end responsiveness, especially in resource-intensive operations.
- Agile Iterations:
Plan Agile iterations that include regular feedback sessions with front-end teams, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving front-end requirements.
Embrace change requests as opportunities for improvement, adapting the back-end swiftly to meet front-end demands.
### Phase 7: Go-Live and Post-Launch Support
- Post-Launch Analysis:
Conduct post-launch analyses focusing on front-end user behavior and feedback.
Continuously monitor front-end errors and crashes, collaborating with front-end developers for rapid bug fixes.
- Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:
Maintain up-to-date technical documentation that serves as a reference for both back-end and front-end teams.
Facilitate knowledge transfer sessions between back-end and front-end developers, fostering mutual understanding of system intricacies.
By following these strategies, the back-end team will demonstrate a deep understanding of engineering practices, effective engagement with business units, precise usage of technical terminology, and an alignment with front-end requirements, ensuring the creation of a highly effective and harmonious back-end system for Tekana-eWallet.
